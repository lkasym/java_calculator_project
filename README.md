# java_calculator_project


## Description

 This Java project implements a simple calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, square root, power, mean, and variance calculations. The calculator is designed for use in a console environment, allowing users to interactively select the operation they wish to perform and input the necessary values.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculate the square root and power of a number.
- Compute the mean and variance of a set of numbers.
- User-friendly console interface for easy operation selection and input.
- Robust input validation and error handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher. This is necessary to compile and run the Java programs.

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the Classes:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and compile the Java classes using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java MainClass.java
   ```

2. **Run the Main Class:**
   After compilation, you can run the main class to start the calculator program:

   ```bash
   java MainClass
   ```

3. **Use the Calculator:**
   Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and input the required numbers. The calculator will display the result of the operation.

## Usage

The calculator provides a menu-driven interface for selecting operations. Here's how to use it:

1. Run the program as described above.
2. When prompted, enter the number corresponding to the desired operation (e.g., 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
3. For operations requiring inputs, enter the numbers as prompted. For mean and variance calculations, enter each number followed by pressing enter, and type 'end' when you're finished inputting numbers.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen. You can then choose another operation or exit the program by selecting '9'.
